NOTICE
------

This repository contains continued private development of the File Activity plugin
authored by dlandon.

Limetech and the Unraid community maintain forks based on earlier GPL versions of this
plugin. Those forks originated from my publicly released GPL code.

This repository continues directly from the same codebase that I authored.
While that earlier work was published under the GPL, all development, commits, and
changes made after March 2025 in this repository are my own independent work and are
not licensed under the GPL.

Only the portions of the code that were publicly released prior to March 2025 remain
under the GPL. All code added, modified, or maintained after that date is proprietary
and governed solely by the custom license contained in the LICENSE file.

Redistribution, commercial use, or creation of modified or derivative versions of this
work is prohibited without prior written permission from the copyright
holder.
